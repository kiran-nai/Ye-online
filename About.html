        <p>Spectra was founded by a group of students who aimed to provide valuable and practical revision resources for GCSE students. Our product enables them to be as successful as possible in their exams whilst also being environmentally conscious. </p>
        <br>
        <p>At Spectra, we strive to serve the education community with comprehensive and personalised revision material written by students. We provide customers with excellent advice and information on where they can find resources and revision techniques that suit them best to achieve their potential in GCSE exam results.</p>
        <br>
        <p>We do this through a subversive approach to revision literature providing resources for students to develop their independent revision techniques and enabling them to gain confidence in revision strategies. We hope they will carry these throughout their lives while maintaining a healthy work-life balance.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Furthermore, we at Spectra are aware of the current climate crisis facing our planet. So we have employed a carbon-negative strategy which means that by purchasing a revision guide, you have a net positive effect on carbon dioxide levels within our atmosphere, guaranteeing a safe academic and environmental future for all.</p>
